# BitStable: A Peer-to-Peer Bitcoin-Collateralized Multi-Currency Electronic Cash System

**Steven Geller**

## Abstract

A purely peer-to-peer multi-currency electronic cash system would allow direct transactions in any currency denomination without financial institutions while maintaining purchasing power stability. Digital signatures solve the authentication problem, but currency stability requires eliminating trusted third parties maintaining pegs. A solution using Bitcoin as collateral in a distributed vault system is proposed. Progressive liquidation mechanisms with graduated thresholds, direct redemption with dynamic fees, and consensus-based price oracles maintain stability. Vault operators lock Bitcoin collateral at minimum ratio *M* = 175% and face liquidation at threshold *L* = 125%. Progressive liquidation occurs at 130%, 127.5%, and 125% collateralization ratios, liquidating 25%, 50%, and 75% respectively before full liquidation. The system remains stable as long as honest participants maintain aggregate collateralization above *L*.

## 1. Introduction

Bitcoin enables final settlement but price volatility σ_BTC prevents use as unit of account. Traditional stablecoins require trusted fiat reserves. The proposed system maintains Bitcoin's cryptographic security while achieving price stability to arbitrary currencies through over-collateralized vaults with collateral ratio *CR* = *V_BTC* × *P_BTC* / *D_total*.

What is needed: an electronic payment system with Bitcoin's settlement finality but stable purchasing power. The solution: peer-to-peer distributed vaults with progressive liquidation maintaining currency pegs through economic incentives rather than trusted reserves.

## 2. Transactions

An electronic stable currency unit is defined as a cryptographically-secured claim on Bitcoin collateral held in vault *V_i* with collateral *B_i* and debt vector **D_i** = {*d_USD*, *d_EUR*, *d_GBP*, ...}.

The double-spending problem for collateral: a vault operator could issue currency beyond safe limits. Traditional solution requires trusted issuer verification. To eliminate trust, vault states must be publicly verifiable with consensus on collateralization ratios.

Define total debt in USD equivalent: *D_total* = Σ_k *d_k* × *r_k* where *r_k* is exchange rate for currency *k*.

Collateralization ratio: *CR* = (*B* × *P_BTC*) / *D_total*

Safety condition: *CR* ≥ *M* at issuance, liquidation at *CR* < *L*.

## 3. Oracle Network

Oracle consensus prevents price manipulation through graduated circuit breaker requiring increasing agreement for larger movements.

Circuit breaker thresholds:
- Δ*P* ≤ 10%: requires 5/7 oracles
- 10% < Δ*P* ≤ 20%: requires 7/7 oracles  
- Δ*P* > 20%: requires governance override

Time-weighted average price over window *T*: *TWAP* = (1/*T*) ∫_0^T *P*(*t*) *dt*

Oracle quality score *Q_i* = Σ_t *w_t* × *accuracy_t* with exponential decay weights *w_t* = *e^(-λt)*.

## 4. Progressive Liquidation

Progressive liquidation prevents cascade failures through staged collateral seizure.

Liquidation stages for vault with *CR*:
- *CR* ≥ 130%: Safe
- 127.5% ≤ *CR* < 130%: Liquidate 25%
- 125% ≤ *CR* < 127.5%: Liquidate 50%  
- 125% ≤ *CR* < 125%: Liquidate 75%
- *CR* < 125%: Full liquidation

Liquidation amount at stage *s*: *A_s* = *p_s* × *D_total* / *P_BTC*

Liquidator bonus: *B_bonus* = *γ* × *A_liquidated* where *γ* = 5%

Total seized: *B_seized* = *A_liquidated* × (1 + *γ*)

## 5. Incentive Structure

Stability fee accrues continuously: *D*(*t*) = *D_0* × *e^(αt)* where *α* is annual rate.

Expected liquidator profit: *E*[*π*] = *γ* × *D_total* × *P*(liquidation)

Vault operator expected return: *E*[*R*] = *α* × *D_total* - *P*(liquidation) × (*V* - *D_total*/*CR*)

Nash equilibrium: operators maintain *CR* > *L* when *E*[*R*] > 0.

## 6. Direct Redemption

Redemption maintains peg through arbitrage. Redeemer targets lowest-*CR* vault above threshold.

Redemption fee: *f*(*t*) = *f_base* + *k* × (*volume*(*t*) / *supply*) where *k* calibrates demand response.

Daily redemption limit per vault: *L_daily* = min(*δ* × *B*, *β* × *D_total*) where *δ* = 10%, *β* = 5%.

## 7. Insurance and Emergency

Insurance fund accumulates at rate *ι* = 1% of fees. Target size: *I_target* = max(0.05 × *D_system*, *VaR_99*).

Emergency triggers:
- System *CR* < 105%  
- Oracle failure rate > 40%
- Single liquidation > $10M

Settlement pro-rata distribution: *payout_i* = *claim_i* / Σ*claims* × *collateral_total*

## 8. Solvency Verification

System collateralization: *CR_system* = (Σ*B_i* × *P_BTC*) / (Σ*D_i*)

Light client verification requires only vault summaries and price data.

Fraud proof: if ∃ vault with *CR* < *L* not liquidated, any node can submit proof of under-collateralization.

## 9. Multi-Currency

Vault *i* maintains debt vector **D_i** = {*d_USD*, *d_EUR*, *d_GBP*} sharing collateral *B_i*.

Constraint: (Σ_k *d_k* × *r_k*) / (*B_i* × *P_BTC*) ≥ *M*

Cross-currency liquidation priority by *CR* per currency: *CR_k* = (*B_i* × *P_BTC*) / (*d_k* × *r_k*)

## 10. Privacy

Vault operators pseudonymous via public keys. Unlinkability through fresh addresses per operation.

Privacy analysis: vault states public, but operator identity private unless explicitly linked.

Information leaked per operation: *I* = log₂(*CR*) + log₂(*D_total*) - log₂(*anonymity_set*)

## 11. Calculations

**Attack Resistance**: Attacker needs >50% of collateral value to manipulate system.

Cost to destabilize: *C_attack* = 0.5 × Σ*B_i* × *P_BTC*

**Progressive Liquidation Probability**: *P*(vault recovery | 25% liquidation) ≈ 0.8

**System Stability**: For *n* independent vaults, failure probability *P_fail* ≈ *e^(-n·p)* where *p* = *P*(honest maintenance).

**Value-at-Risk**: Daily 99% VaR = -2.33 × *σ_daily* × *portfolio_value*

**Liquidation Bound**: Vault becomes liquidatable when *P_BTC* falls below *P_liq* = (*D_total* × *L*) / *B*

## 12. Conclusion

A mathematically-sound system for peer-to-peer multi-currency electronic cash using Bitcoin collateral has been presented. Progressive liquidation with thresholds *M* = 175%, partial liquidation at 130%, and full liquidation at *L* = 125% maintains system stability. Graduated oracle consensus prevents price manipulation. Direct redemption and insurance funds provide additional stability mechanisms. The system eliminates trusted third parties while achieving price stability through cryptographic proofs and economic incentives, extending Bitcoin's security model to stable-value transactions.
