# BitStable: A Peer-to-Peer Bitcoin-Collateralized Multi-Currency Electronic Cash System

**Steven Geller**

## Abstract

A purely peer-to-peer multi-currency electronic cash system would allow direct transactions in any currency denomination without financial institutions while maintaining purchasing power stability. Digital signatures solve the authentication problem, but currency stability requires eliminating trusted third parties maintaining pegs. A solution using Bitcoin as collateral in a distributed vault system is proposed. Progressive liquidation mechanisms with graduated thresholds, direct redemption with dynamic fees, and consensus-based price oracles maintain stability. Vault operators lock Bitcoin collateral at minimum ratio *M* = 175% and face liquidation at threshold *L* = 125%. Progressive liquidation occurs at 130%, 127.5%, and 125% collateralization ratios, liquidating 25%, 50%, and 75% respectively before full liquidation. The system remains stable as long as honest participants maintain aggregate collateralization above *L*.

## 1. Introduction

Bitcoin enables final settlement but price volatility σ_BTC prevents use as unit of account. Traditional stablecoins require trusted fiat reserves. The proposed system maintains Bitcoin's cryptographic security while achieving price stability to arbitrary currencies through over-collateralized vaults with collateral ratio *CR* = *V_BTC* × *P_BTC* / *D_total*.

What is needed: an electronic payment system with Bitcoin's settlement finality but stable purchasing power. The solution: peer-to-peer distributed vaults with progressive liquidation maintaining currency pegs through economic incentives rather than trusted reserves.

## 2. Transactions

An electronic stable currency unit is defined as a cryptographically-secured claim on Bitcoin collateral held in vault *V_i* with collateral *B_i* and debt vector **D_i** = {*d_USD*, *d_EUR*, *d_GBP*, ...}.

The double-spending problem for collateral: a vault operator could issue currency beyond safe limits. Traditional solution requires trusted issuer verification. To eliminate trust, vault states must be publicly verifiable with consensus on collateralization ratios.

Define total debt in USD equivalent: *D_total* = Σ_k *d_k* × *r_k* where *r_k* is exchange rate for currency *k*.

Collateralization ratio: *CR* = (*B* × *P_BTC*) / *D_total*

Safety condition: *CR* ≥ *M* at issuance, liquidation at *CR* < *L*.

## 3. Enhanced Oracle Network

Oracle consensus prevents price manipulation through multi-source aggregation, bonding requirements, and graduated circuit breakers requiring increasing agreement for larger movements.

**Multi-Source Aggregation**: System aggregates from 20+ heterogeneous price sources including exchanges, market makers, and decentralized oracles to prevent single-point-of-failure.

**Oracle Bonding**: Each oracle stakes bond *B_oracle* = 2 × *max_daily_volume* × *P_BTC* / 365. Bond slashed for:
- Deviation >5% from consensus: 10% slash
- Offline >1 hour: 5% slash  
- Manipulation evidence: 100% slash

Circuit breaker thresholds with bonded consensus:
- Δ*P* ≤ 10%: requires 15/20+ bonded oracles
- 10% < Δ*P* ≤ 20%: requires 18/20+ bonded oracles
- Δ*P* > 20%: requires governance override + emergency committee

Time-weighted average price over window *T*: *TWAP* = (1/*T*) ∫_0^T *P*(*t*) *dt*

**Freshness Requirements**: Price data stale if >30s old. Automatic failover to backup oracles within 10s.

**Reputation Model**: Oracle quality score *Q_i* = Σ_t *w_t* × *accuracy_t* × *uptime_t* with exponential decay weights *w_t* = *e^(-λt)*. Reputation affects bonding requirements and reward distribution.

## 4. Progressive Liquidation with Cascade Prevention

Progressive liquidation prevents cascade failures through staged collateral seizure with rate limiting and smoothing mechanisms.

**Liquidation Stages** for vault with *CR*:
- *CR* ≥ 130%: Safe
- 127.5% ≤ *CR* < 130%: Liquidate 25%
- 125% ≤ *CR* < 127.5%: Liquidate 50%  
- 125% ≤ *CR* < 125%: Liquidate 75%
- *CR* < 125%: Full liquidation

**Cascade Prevention**: Maximum liquidation volume per block: *V_max* = min(0.1 × *supply_total*, $10M equivalent)

**Rate Limiting**: Individual vault liquidation rate *R_vault* ≤ 50% per hour to prevent flash crashes.

**Smoothing Function**: Liquidation penalty *γ*(*V*) = *γ_base* + *k* × log(1 + *V*/*V_threshold*) where *γ_base* = 5%

Liquidation amount at stage *s*: *A_s* = *p_s* × *D_total* / *P_BTC*

Liquidator bonus: *B_bonus* = *γ*(*V*) × *A_liquidated*

Total seized: *B_seized* = *A_liquidated* × (1 + *γ*(*V*))

**Emergency Breaks**: Automatic 1-hour trading halt if >20% of system collateral liquidated in 10 minutes.

## 5. Incentive Structure

Stability fee accrues continuously: *D*(*t*) = *D_0* × *e^(αt)* where *α* is annual rate.

Expected liquidator profit: *E*[*π*] = *γ* × *D_total* × *P*(liquidation)

Vault operator expected return: *E*[*R*] = *α* × *D_total* - *P*(liquidation) × (*V* - *D_total*/*CR*)

Nash equilibrium: operators maintain *CR* > *L* when *E*[*R*] > 0.

## 6. Direct Redemption

Redemption maintains peg through arbitrage. Redeemer targets lowest-*CR* vault above threshold.

Redemption fee: *f*(*t*) = *f_base* + *k* × (*volume*(*t*) / *supply*) where *k* calibrates demand response.

Daily redemption limit per vault: *L_daily* = min(*δ* × *B*, *β* × *D_total*) where *δ* = 10%, *β* = 5%.

## 7. Insurance and Emergency

Insurance fund accumulates at rate *ι* = 1% of fees. Target size: *I_target* = max(0.05 × *D_system*, *VaR_99*).

Emergency triggers:
- System *CR* < 105%  
- Oracle failure rate > 40%
- Single liquidation > $10M

Settlement pro-rata distribution: *payout_i* = *claim_i* / Σ*claims* × *collateral_total*

## 8. Proof-of-Reserves and Solvency Verification

**Continuous Proof-of-Reserves**: Every Bitcoin block contains Merkle tree commitment to all vault states.

Merkle tree construction: *M_root* = MerkleRoot({*H*(*vault_i* ‖ *B_i* ‖ *D_i* ‖ *timestamp*)})

Bitcoin OP_RETURN commitment: *H*(*M_root* ‖ *block_height* ‖ *system_state*)

**Light Client Verification**: Users verify vault inclusion via Merkle proof + Bitcoin block validation.

**Solvency Formula**: *CR_system* = (Σ*B_i* × *P_BTC*) / (Σ*D_i*)

**Real-time Auditability**: 
- Vault states: *S_vault* = {*B_i*, **D_i**, *timestamp_i*, *signature_i*}
- System state: *S_system* = {*CR_system*, *total_debt*, *oracle_health*, *insurance_balance*}
- Proof generation: *π* = (*M_proof*, *inclusion_path*, *block_header*)

**Fraud Proofs**: If ∃ vault with *CR* < *L* not liquidated, any node can submit cryptographic proof *π_fraud* = (*vault_state*, *timestamp*, *oracle_prices*, *merkle_proof*) to trigger automatic liquidation.

**Transparency Guarantees**: All vault operations publicly verifiable without revealing operator identity.

## 9. Multi-Currency with Simplified Implementation

**Phased Deployment**: Launch with USD-only implementation, expanding to EUR, GBP, JPY based on adoption.

Vault *i* maintains debt vector **D_i** = {*d_USD*, *d_EUR*, *d_GBP*} sharing collateral *B_i*.

**Unified Constraint**: (Σ_k *d_k* × *r_k*) / (*B_i* × *P_BTC*) ≥ *M*

**Currency-Specific Risk**: Cross-currency liquidation priority by *CR* per currency: *CR_k* = (*B_i* × *P_BTC*) / (*d_k* × *r_k*)

**Exchange Rate Oracle**: Separate bonded oracle network for FX rates with similar reputation and slashing mechanisms.

**Complexity Reduction**: Initial deployment targets major currency pairs (USD, EUR) before expanding to emerging markets to reduce oracle and liquidity complexity.

## 10. Privacy

Vault operators pseudonymous via public keys. Unlinkability through fresh addresses per operation.

Privacy analysis: vault states public, but operator identity private unless explicitly linked.

Information leaked per operation: *I* = log₂(*CR*) + log₂(*D_total*) - log₂(*anonymity_set*)

## 11. Calculations

**Attack Resistance**: Attacker needs >50% of collateral value to manipulate system.

Cost to destabilize: *C_attack* = 0.5 × Σ*B_i* × *P_BTC*

**Progressive Liquidation Probability**: *P*(vault recovery | 25% liquidation) ≈ 0.8

**System Stability**: For *n* independent vaults, failure probability *P_fail* ≈ *e^(-n·p)* where *p* = *P*(honest maintenance).

**Oracle Bonding Economics**: Bond requirement *B_oracle* = 2 × *max_daily_volume* × *P_BTC* / 365 ensures cost of manipulation exceeds potential profit.

**Proof-of-Reserves Efficiency**: Merkle tree size scales as O(log *n*) for *n* vaults, enabling efficient verification.

**Value-at-Risk**: Daily 99% VaR = -2.33 × *σ_daily* × *portfolio_value*

**Liquidation Bound**: Vault becomes liquidatable when *P_BTC* falls below *P_liq* = (*D_total* × *L*) / *B*

**Cascade Resistance**: Maximum single-block liquidation limited to 10% of system collateral prevents flash crashes.

## 12. Security Enhancements Summary

**Oracle Security**: 20+ bonded sources with reputation scoring, slashing for misbehavior, and automatic failover mechanisms.

**Proof-of-Reserves**: Every Bitcoin block commits to complete system state via Merkle trees, enabling real-time auditability.

**Liquidation Safety**: Rate limiting, smoothing functions, and emergency breaks prevent cascade failures.

**Transparency**: All operations cryptographically verifiable while preserving operator privacy.
